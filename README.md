# How much would you spend to get your kid educated in the U.S. as a Chinese international student?
### Coming to another country is never easy. Due to various reasons, many parents, like mine, are sending their kids to the U.S. for education and later for their career, which finally lead to a wish for immigration.

This is an interactive news game where you can explore various options for sending your kids to the U.S. for education. Just play with it!

**Methodology**:
Based on my own experiences and interviews with international students, I conducted preliminary reporting to gain general knowledge about the situation. Using **Inky**, I created this game and designed different options according to my interviewees' experiences. These options represent most of the choices that Chinese students and parents make when pursuing studies abroad.

**New Learnings**:
I learned to use Inky.
